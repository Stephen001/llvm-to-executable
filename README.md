LLVM IR to Executable Compiler Image
====================================
This repository provides a docker image that accepts LLVM IR (via mounted volume) and compiles it for an [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) environment, for execution. In the future, this image is likely to be branched to offer different execution environments, according to expected common tools.
